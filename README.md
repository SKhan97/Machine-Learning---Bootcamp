# Machine-Learning---Bootcamp
Code that was written while at a ML bootcamp that taught me the theory behind ML algorithms, neural networks and extensions of them (RNNs, CNNs etc). 

Note:
All code is written in Python, making use of Pytorch, Numpy and Matplotlib.
The code has been uploaded as it was written so earlier files will not include techniques learnt later (e.g. Batch normalisation will occur in later, more difficult code but no in Linear Regression).
Code was written in Google Colab. The only difference as a result is the importing of files, which can be easily modified to make it work outside of Colab.
