# Machine-Learning---Bootcamp
Course on Machine Learning I undertook, teaching the theory and implementation of techniques from logistic regression to different types of neural networks and a few techniques to analyse data. This code was written and run on Google Colab servers and utilises
the torch module for building neural networks. The data required are given and the relevant IPython notebooks alongside them.
