# Machine-Learning---Bootcamp
Machine learning course I assisted in teaching with Imperial Machine Learning society. I helped teach the theory and implementation of techniques from logistic regression to different types of neural networks and a few techniques to analyse data. This code was written and run on Google Colab servers and utilises the torch module for building neural networks. The data required are given and the relevant IPython notebooks alongside them.
