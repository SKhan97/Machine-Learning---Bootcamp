# Machine-Learning---Bootcamp
Code that was written while at a ML bootcamp that taught me the theory behind ML algorithms, neural networks and extensions of them (RNNs, CNNs etc). 

Note:
The code has been uploaded as it was written so earlier files will not include techniques learnt later (e.g. Batch normalisation will occur in later, more difficult code but not in Linear Regression).
Code was executed in Google Colab (makes it easier to use torch module).
